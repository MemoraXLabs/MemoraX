<h1>MemoraX</h1>
<p><strong>The memory layer for long-horizon intelligence</strong></p>

<p>
MemoraX is not a product, an agent, or a model.<br>
It is the layer that allows intelligent systems to persist across time.
</p>

<p>
Modern AI is episodic.<br>
It generates, responds, and resets.
</p>

<p>
Long-horizon intelligence requires something different:<br>
a layer that carries identity, context, and accumulated understanding forward between interactions.
</p>

<p>
That layer is memory.<br>
MemoraX is its name.

<h2>What this repository is</h2>

<p>
This repository is the canonical reference for the memory layer of long-horizon intelligence.
</p>

<p>
It is not an implementation.<br>
It is the definition and namespace of where continuity, identity, and persistence live in the AI stack.
</p>

<p>
Models reason.<br>
Tools execute.<br>
MemoraX persists.
</p>

<p>
Every intelligent system is bounded by how far its memory can reach.<br>
MemoraX is the layer that extends that horizon.
